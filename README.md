challenge: brain tumor classification from MRI images
This code was awarded 1st place in the first `event and challenge of applying AI in medicine` which was held by AI Association of Azad University North Tehran Branch in 10 April 2025.
The model is based on a paper from 2023, and was implemented in google colab environment with pyTorch. The code is also includes preprocessing and augmentation plus xai with GRAD-CAM.

The final version which was represented for the challenge can be found in the commit with the message : "final version for the challenge" 
All the prevoius attempts are in the commit history.
